# VyomSan Token :)

This is a simple Solidity smart contract for creating and managing a token named "VyomSan" (VS). The contract allows you to mint and burn tokens. You can run and interact with this contract in Remix, a web-based Solidity IDE.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

Access to the Remix Solidity IDE: [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
